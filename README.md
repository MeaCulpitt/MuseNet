# MuseNet: Decentralized Human Music Creation & Curation Subnet on Bittensor

**A Bittensor subnet that rewards real human musicians for submitting high-quality, original music tracks and stems — with fiat-only UX so creators never touch crypto.**

## 1. Project Overview

### Abstract
MuseNet is a Bittensor subnet designed to create the world's first decentralized, incentive-aligned marketplace for **human-created music**. Musicians submit original tracks or stems in response to daily challenges or open pools. Validators score submissions using a mix of objective audio metrics, originality checks, and stake-weighted perceptual quality. Top-ranked tracks earn TAO emissions — which are automatically converted to fiat payouts via Stripe/PayPal, making the entire crypto/TAO layer invisible to creators.

This solves a core pain point in the $30B+ music industry: independent musicians struggle with low royalties, biased discovery, and fragmented monetization. MuseNet flips the model by turning creative effort into verifiable "proof of human intelligence," using Bittensor's Yuma Consensus to surface the best music globally through merit-based competition — without gatekeepers.

Key differentiators:
- **Human-first**: Authentic, editable music from real producers (not AI-generated).
- **Fiat abstraction**: Musicians upload via email/Google, get paid in dollars — no wallets or TAO required.
- **Competitive incentives**: Emissions reward quality and originality, creating a continuous "Hunger Games" for creators.
- **Remix-ready outputs**: Bonus for multi-stem submissions, enabling downstream use in content, games, ads, and remixes.
- **Composable**: Integrates with other Bittensor subnets (compute for mastering, agents for auto-remixing, data for reference stems).

### Why Bittensor?
Bittensor is uniquely suited because it natively incentivizes verifiable, competitive intelligence — even when the intelligence is creative and partially subjective. Stake-weighted consensus handles artistic judgment fairly, emissions bootstrap supply without VC dilution, and permissionless participation unlocks global talent. No centralized platform can match this flywheel for surfacing high-quality, human music at scale.

### Core Value Proposition
- For musicians: Instant, merit-based fiat earnings + global exposure without algorithms or pay-to-play.
- For users (creators, brands, devs): Access to fresh, customizable, royalty-friendly music via simple API or web interface.
- For the Bittensor ecosystem: A high-signal creative vertical that attracts non-crypto users, demonstrating real-world adoption potential.

### High-Level Flow
1. Validators post daily challenges (e.g., "60s chill lo-fi beat with rainy vibe") or open pool.
2. Musicians upload tracks/stems via clean fiat web app.
3. Backend submits to subnet (IPFS hash + metadata).
4. Validators score (technical + originality + perceptual).
5. Yuma Consensus ranks → emissions to top tracks.
6. Earnings auto-converted → fiat paid to creator.

### Target Impact
Short-term: Bootstrap 1,000+ musicians with bounty payouts and viral challenges.  
Medium-term: Become the go-to source for authentic, remixable music in content creation and indie games.  
Long-term: Transition to sustainable licensing/royalty revenue while keeping emissions as a quality flywheel.

MuseNet proves Bittensor can power creative economies beyond AI inference — unlocking human intelligence in a decentralized, rewarding way.
